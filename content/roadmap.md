> As Europe moves towards a true digital economy, we can make more from all the opportunities offered by data and data-driven innovation in the financial sector. More sharing of personal data, while retaining full control over it, will allow people to access tailored products and services that suit their needs, and also create room for the financial industry to innovate. Today’s proposals set strict conditions on rights and obligations for open data-sharing to protect privacy, and to give full control to customers over access to their data and how it is used. The same principles apply to new data technology developments in payment services, where we intend to reinforce consumer protection - including by improving fraud prevention - and make sure that consumers are offered the best and cheapest payment service.

**Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People - 28/06/2023**

> Today we are taking concrete steps to modernise not only the EU’s retail payments industry but the financial service sector as a whole. In doing so, we are putting the best interests of citizens and consumers at the heart of financial services. In the EU’s growing data economy, every interaction in finance creates new data. It is therefore vital that European consumers remain the ones in control of their payments and they decide with whom to share this data so that they can avail of new and innovative products. Today we are proposing a set of measures including enhanced protection for consumers making electronic payments in the EU and improved criteria to prevent and remedy payment fraud. This proposal will ensure customers and businesses benefit from more innovative payment and financial service options, whilst being confident that these are offered in a safe, transparent and secure way.

**Mairead McGuinness, Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union - 28/06/2023**
